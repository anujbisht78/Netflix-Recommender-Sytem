# Netflix Recommender System

The Netflix Recommender System is a project aimed at enhancing user experience on the popular streaming platform by providing personalized movie and TV show recommendations. Using machine learning algorithms such as collaborative filtering, the system analyzes user preferences and viewing history to suggest content tailored to individual tastes. Integrated with Flask for backend functionality and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, this system offers a seamless and intuitive interface for users to discover new and relevant content based on their interests and viewing habits.
